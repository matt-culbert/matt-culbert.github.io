Let’s say you use KeyFarce to dump the KeyPass contents, how are you planning on retrieving that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With this function, we get a file path and an upload URL, read it in binary format since that allows requests to determine the Content-length header, and then send it off to the URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This command is called with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     upload;{url};{file to upload]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The Brains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Finally, the brains of the beacon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     The beacon does a GET to the C2 URL and splits the response on semicolons. There are four options pre built in. Cmd, inject, download, and upload. Each command calls their respective function that we reviewed above. For testing purposes, we are posting to httpbin.org/post which helps illustrate how the data is sent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The mTLS is performed in the GET request every time it is used. We just need the client cert, key, and the CA cert file loaded either locally on Linux or into the cert chain on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Why GET Requests?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;    A series of GET requests may not be the most graceful way of retrieving commands from our controller, but it does hide itself well among the typical internet traffic you might see. We have changed the user-agent as well to appear more like normal internet traffic, stealing the one FireFox uses. The overall beacon design is very flexible as well. If you don’t care about getting responses back, you can just set up a simple web page for commands to be retrieved from and put Nginx in front of it to keep prying eyes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;    There are some issues that are caused by our use of ctypes here. Microsoft identifies this as malicious right away. Then, a lot of EDR vendors will pickup on the CreateRemoteThread flag that we use heavily in the DLL injection portions. VirtualAllocEx will also stand out to a lot of EDR tools but mainly when you allocate memory with read/write/execute permissions and that’s never a good idea. What we’ve done here is allocate the memory with read/write and then we create a new  thread with an entry point to the LoadLibrary function that then points to our DLL. Despite all this, this goes undetected by a fair amount of vendors on Virustotal which isn’t too surprising to see. SentinelOne, Microsoft, and Elastic are top of the field when it comes to identifying new and emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;    Making your own C2 is a lot of fun and there’s a ton of learning that comes with it along the way. You have to address how to hide commands being run, how to exfiltrate information, and how deal with commands being fetched. I had played with Empire and Metasploit previously but had not delved into how they handle multiple compromised endpoints too much, so this was a fun opportunity to solve this problem on my own. There were roadblocks with features that should have been implemented, mainly process injection. It would have been nice to get this implemented but if you’re going to use ctypes that much, you may as well just use C. It wasn’t showcased here either, but handling multiple compromised endpoints is as simple as changing the URL each beacon checks into before compiling into an EXE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","headline":"Switchblade To Swiss Army Knife: Expanding The Toolset With Python","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/posts/switchblade-to-swiss-army-knife-adding/"},"url":"/posts/switchblade-to-swiss-army-knife-adding/"}</script><title>Switchblade To Swiss Army Knife: Expanding The Toolset With Python | Culbert Report</title><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png"><link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/assets/img/favicons/favicon-32x32.png"><link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"><link rel="manifest" href="/assets/img/favicons/site.webmanifest"><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/assets/img/favicons/favicon.ico"><meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="Culbert Report"><meta name="application-name" content="Culbert Report"><meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#da532c"><meta name="msapplication-config" content="/assets/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml"><meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" ><link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" ><link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin><link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin><link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" ><link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" ><link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net" ><link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net" ><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato&family=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@400;600;700;900&display=swap"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@5.11.2/css/all.min.css"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tocbot@4.20.1/dist/tocbot.min.css"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/magnific-popup@1/dist/magnific-popup.min.css"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3/dist/jquery.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> class ModeToggle { static get MODE_KEY() { return "mode";

This was a C2 technique that utilized mutual TLS to authenticate beacons that were compromised and separate them out from other traffic. I won't rehash it too much but it was a cool (in my opinion) way to use Nginx to authenticate beacons with an unusual method and would be considered zero trust since the beacon authenticated to the server and the server authenticated to the beacon.</span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since then, some stuff has changed and some stuff has been updated.<a href="https://github.com/matt-culbert/Switchblade/blob/main/beacon.py" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> Find the details here</a>. Mainly, things could be done easier if the beacon did away with just a simple shell. So the beacon was changed to perform a GET request to the C2 which would have some response options. You can download a file or upload a file, you can inject a DLL into a process, or you can run a command such as cmd.exe or notepad.exe or calc.exe.

We have changed the user-agent as well to appear more like normal internet traffic, stealing the one FireFox uses. The overall beacon design is very flexible as well. If you don't care about getting responses back, you can just set up a simple web page for commands to be retrieved from and put Nginx in front of it to keep prying eyes away.<br /></span></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts</h2><p style="text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are some issues that are caused by our use of ctypes here. Microsoft identifies this as malicious right away. Then, a lot of EDR vendors will pickup on the CreateRemoteThread flag that we use heavily in the DLL injection portions. VirtualAllocEx will also stand out to a lot of EDR tools but mainly when you allocate memory with read/write/execute permissions and that's never a good idea. What we've done here is allocate the memory with read/write and then we create a new&nbsp; thread with an entry point to the LoadLibrary function that then points to our DLL. Despite all this, this goes undetected by a fair amount of vendors on Virustotal which isn't too surprising to see. SentinelOne, Microsoft, and Elastic are top of the field when it comes to identifying new and emerging threats.<br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipYArzpHTKcDqZoTU1I1_4mrnGjJr4mxiJCjJTHA3iObrVUbA9fmxQEpxqPErUvS3f6vHqtL8XQQbMx4xmuGElZN4QdjQ_wJY4TuuNNuQxLQIOQkumqopAHKsY6q1mQYESTWYuXqLhqPQn1PRWzV2KyB5d4R_22ECBaHCn-VZSPO6iWG16MM7mvhHaJw/s1329/detections.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" class="img-link shimmer" ><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 870 332'%3E%3C/svg%3E" border="0" data-original-height="505" data-original-width="1329" height="332" data-src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipYArzpHTKcDqZoTU1I1_4mrnGjJr4mxiJCjJTHA3iObrVUbA9fmxQEpxqPErUvS3f6vHqtL8XQQbMx4xmuGElZN4QdjQ_wJY4TuuNNuQxLQIOQkumqopAHKsY6q1mQYESTWYuXqLhqPQn1PRWzV2KyB5d4R_22ECBaHCn-VZSPO6iWG16MM7mvhHaJw/w870-h332/detections.png" width="870" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></div><br /><br /><p></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making your own C2 is a lot of fun and there's a ton of learning that comes with it along the way. You have to address how to hide commands being run, how to exfiltrate information, and how deal with commands being fetched. I had played with Empire and Metasploit previously but had not delved into how they handle multiple compromised endpoints too much, so this was a fun opportunity to solve this problem on my own. There were roadblocks with features that should have been implemented, mainly process injection. It would have been nice to get this implemented but if you're going to use ctypes that much, you may as well just use C.
