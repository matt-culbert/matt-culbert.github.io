One that caught my eye was a Japanese color combination dictionary, originally printed in 1934 and reprinted and translated over the years. A combination that I found particularly nice was this one pictured below; scarlet, white, and pistachio green.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/art/flower.jpg" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/img/art/flower.jpg" alt="flower.jpg" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>In “The Art Of Doing Science &amp; Engineering” Richard Hamming suggests that a computer learns and creates much the same way that humans do; by being shown a subject and then deriving new ideas and concepts from this content. This comparison is something I struggle with because, intuitively, I want to say that of course the way I learn and develop information is different, but I haven’t thought about the “why” harder than that. I’m taking this opportunity now to structure a counter argument to this and, hopefully, help sway others that the way humans create art in all its forms is not something a machine can ever do. In this post, I will generally talk about expression through writing. However, the argument I present easily translates to any other form of artistic expression.</p><h1 id="influenced-by-vs-derived-from">Influenced by vs derived from</h1><p>What does it mean to create? To answer that, you must answer the question of how your past influences how you think. Humans in general are influenced by their experiences accrued over their lifetimes. This experience has a cascading effect on how individuals view the world, actions by others, and interactions they have. The author Robert Heinlein, for example, was influenced by his time spent in the military service, the influence of which can be seen in his titular piece “Starship Troopers.” The stories that authors tell are a reflection of their life’s experiences, things that they find joy in or dislike, consciously integrated or not. When James S. A. Corey wrote “The Expanse,” they took quite a bit of influence for their universe from authors like Robert Heinlein. When Tolkien wrote Lord Of The Rings, the world wars had heavily shaped his sense of self and Tolkien even said it would be impossible to separate out the influence on theme that these events had on his writing. At an even lower level, a signal for how an author has been influenced can be seen in their word choice. Authors will spend immense amounts of time pouring over what word they will use to describe any given scenario; the final choice being not only what they decided best described a scene but also being a reflection of what they have read and been influenced by in their lifetime. Each word in a novel was consciously put there for a reason by an author based on their personal history with language.</p><p>Conversely, a derivative work builds upon a universe already created, and acts within the established rules and narratives. Derivative work isn’t always a bad thing, but it will always face these constraints. When creating a derivative or a novel story, authors will draw on their lived experiences in order to create a relatable narrative, but models can’t. Instead, models will pull together ideas from shallow themes that are semi-related, unaware of the zeitgeist which influenced contemporary storytellers. Models will perhaps even attempt to integrate stories with much more complex underlying themes than the initial relationship identified, further convoluting the final product. An example of how complicated narratives can become is through fairytales. Without understanding the cultural relationship these stories have, you would immediately encounter an issue with grounding. The reason for that is traditional fairytales are actually rooted in true belief. Katherine Briggs wrote of this in her book “An Encyclopedia of Fairies” back in 1976:</p><blockquote><p>“When he speaks of true fairy beliefs, he ordinarily means those actually believed by people as opposed to the fancies of literary storytellers, who are sometimes imbued with folk tradition and sometimes pin their material out of their own heads or follow the current literary fashion.”</p></blockquote><p>An example of that first classification of stories, those believed by people, is the Brown Man of the Muirs. The tale goes that two young men were hunting on the moors and stopped to eat. While eating, the youngest of the two goes to drink from a burn and that’s when the Brown Man of the Muirs comes out of the trees on the other side. The Brown Man reproves of the hunters killing the animals in his charge and admonishes them to stop. The two hunters decide to go home at that point and, on their way, the youngest shoots a bird so as to prove the encounter didn’t affect him. Immediately, he feels a stabbing pain in his shoulder and shortly after dies. This is what’s known as a <em>true fairy belief.</em> Authors such as Tolkien have borrowed mysticism from stories like this one. Tolkien specifically based the character Tom Bombadil off of the Brown Man.</p><p>J. K. Rowling’s portent of death, the Grim, is also an example of imbuing a story with folk belief. The Grim, along with Sirius Black, are both based off of “black dogs” in English folklore. In Rowling’s novels, it’s believed that anyone who sees the Grim will soon die. This is quite similar to the European “black dogs” folklore, which have stories focused around generally not interacting with them for fear of death. Sirius Black, on the other hand, is written with a more modern interpretation of English “black dog” folklore. Briggs tells us that these dogs are supposed to be the form taken by a human ghost and, beginning in the 19th century, stories were told of them guiding lost travelers and protecting these travelers from danger. This closely aligns with how Sirius Black acted in the novels; constantly following Harry to protect him.</p><h1 id="human-derived-vs-llm-derived">Human derived vs LLM derived</h1><p>Why is derivative work by a human more interesting or compelling than a derivative work generated by an LLM? The answer is the same reason a novel work is interesting to us. I mentioned briefly how authors will pour over every word they choose and that this language choice is a reflection of their background, and I think now is a good time to expound on this more. Understanding the affect an authors background has on their writing will explain why, derivative or not, it’ll always be more interesting.</p><p>In Dan Simmons’s Hyperion, there are two characters whose writing demonstrate this concept of intentional word choice very clearly; that is Martin Silenus and Sol Weintraub. Martin is written as an alcoholic poet with a very wealthy upbringing and whose character revels in debauchery, even going so far as to make himself a satyr. At one point, Martin offhandedly refers to another character’s story as a soporific, that is something to dull your senses and put you to sleep with. For an alcoholic poet, it makes perfect sense that Martin would use a term so analogous to getting drunk, especially since poets are often thought of as masters of language. The second character, Sol, is introduced as a prototypical ivy league graduate student; he wears clothes from the Crawford Squire, he’s on a path to become a teacher, and he carries around a book titled ‘Solitudes In Variance.’ This is all to say that he seems very focused on his own path in life. Later, when Sol and his wife have a baby, it is referred to as “an intrusion upon his solipsistic life.” The term solipsistic is rooted in solipsism which is the theory of being sure of nothing in life except your own being. Like with Martin, the word choice here is tied to how the character would speak of themselves. It’s also a reflection of Simmons’s background; Simmons has an undergrad degree in English and a masters in education. He’s clearly someone who takes great care to find the right word and draws upon a wealth of passionate personal reading to accomplish this. This background is not something that can ever be replicated by an LLM because passion in writing cannot be artificial. The limiting factor in quality has never been the amount of samples that you can paraphrase from, but rather the joy in which someone takes in learning and applying words.</p><h1 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h1><p>You shouldn’t use any of these LLM’s anyways, but a bonus reason you shouldn’t use them for creative work is that “creating” is an expression of who you are; it’s not about the final output, but instead it’s about the work you put in to creating your story. And if you’re not writing for the joy of it, then what’s the point? Robert Heinlein put it well in “Starship Troopers” when he talked about value being relative. In the story, Mr. Dubois asks Johnny how he would feel if he gave Johnny the first place medal in the 100 meter dash. Johnny got understandably flustered since he earned only third in that very race last week and Mr. Dubois drove home the point that value is relative to individual work contributed to earning something. Without that work, there’s no meaning to the final product.</p><blockquote><p>In the beginning was the Word. Then came the fucking word processor. Then came the thought processor. Then came the death of literature. And so it goes.
