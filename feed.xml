A note When I began writing this, it was June in Vermont and one of the hottest summers we’ve had. Some towns reported a heat index of 120 Fahrenheit. Now, it’s October, and the temperature outside is 87. In October, in Vermont. To say that climate change is happen... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Building A Detection Lab Around Suricata</title><link href="/posts/Building-A-Detection-Lab-Around-Suricata/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building A Detection Lab Around Suricata" /><published>2024-07-11T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2025-09-10T18:08:10+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/Building-A-Detection-Lab-Around-Suricata/</id> <content src="/posts/Building-A-Detection-Lab-Around-Suricata/" /> <author> <name>Matt Culbert</name> </author> <summary> Building A Detection Lab Around Suricata A while back there were a flurry of posts from different people about how they were configuring their homelabs, rebuilding them to do X better than something else normally used, and automating this and that. My interest was piqued since I hadn’t played around with my equipment in a while, so I started writing up a post of my own in order to join the f... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Making Red Teaming Safer</title><link href="/posts/Making-Red-Teaming-Safer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making Red Teaming Safer" /><published>2024-02-15T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2024-02-15T19:34:33+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/Making-Red-Teaming-Safer/</id> <content src="/posts/Making-Red-Teaming-Safer/" /> <author> <name>Matt Culbert</name> </author> <summary> I have been quietly hard at work the past few months turning an old project that didn’t quite work even half the time into a framework that provides the solid base of functionality required to build something much larger off of. But first, some background. Last year, I made a post about designing a red team framework. It was the offshoot of a Vault 7 project I made in Python and the first one... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Subdomain Takeovers</title><link href="/posts/Subdomain-Takeovers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Subdomain Takeovers" /><published>2023-12-08T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-12-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/Subdomain-Takeovers/</id> <content src="/posts/Subdomain-Takeovers/" /> <author> <name>Matt Culbert</name> </author> <summary> A quick story of a misconfiguration This is a very quick post, I’m working on others I promise. On Dec 8, I went to my site, git.culbertreport.com, and all looked good. I then went to cr.culbertreport.com to try and fix an issue with that returning a 404 and I found a crypto site. I’m not going to lie, I kinda panicked for a minute.

When I say evasion, I’m referring to both evading prying eyes from analysts and avoiding their attention, as well as evading AV and EDR. We can see how espionage operations in 2000 led to advancements in EDR and OS mitigations today in 2023. The Equation Group is fascinating to study in this area because for so long their operations... </summary> </entry> </feed>
